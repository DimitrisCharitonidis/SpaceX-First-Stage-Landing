# SpaceX First Stage Landing Project
## This public repository is created to upload the Jupyter notebooks associated with a project which aims to predict whether the first stage of the rocket launch process of the SpaceX rocket company (for Falcon 9 rockets) will land successfully.
### More specifically, this repository includes five (5) Jupyter notebooks which contain the following:
### • Data Collection-Wrangling: data collection and data wrangling for the pre-processing of the data, creating a landing outcome label (0 when the booster did not land successfully and 1 when it did), in order to be utilized for EDA.
### • Exploratory Data Analysis: depicts visualization relationships between variables and determines patterns with the help-utilization of Pandas and Matplotlib libraries and also, SQL queries which try to manipulate and evaluate the SpaceX dataset.
### • Interactive Visual Analytics and Launch Site location: depicts visualization geospatial analytics using Folium library for the launch sites.
### • Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard App: creation of a dashboard application for interactive visualizations using Plotly Dash.
### • Data Modelling and Prediction: pre-processing (standardization) of the data using Scikit-Learn, splitting them into training and test datasets, training them using different classification models, finding hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and then, plotting confusion matrices for each classification model and assessing the accuracy of each model.
